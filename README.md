# mandelbrot
using Python to generate an image of the Mandelbrot set, which is a famous mathematical fractal that is known for its complex, detailed structure and beauty

This code will generate and display an image of the Mandelbrot set using Python's matplotlib library. The image will have a resolution of 500x500 pixels and will use 20 iterations to calculate the values for each pixel. The resulting image is a stunning visual representation of the complex structure of the Mandelbrot set.
